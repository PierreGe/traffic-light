\section{Conclusion}
Thanks to this project, we now have a better understanding of what is formal verification and how it is possible to do it. We experimented the development of a system driven by model checking. \\
The problem in those kind of models is to be able to identify the main issues that could happen in the real world and to write the properties related to it. The second difficulty is to write the correct automatons related to those real models but thanks to those automatons, a lot of useful properties could be defined and verified.\\
Model checking helps us to be sure that our system is correct, if the model is correct of course. If it is not the case, model checking helps us to highlight what is wrong in the system.
