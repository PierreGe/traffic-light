\section{Conclusion}
Thanks to this project, we created a real (but small) embedded system and we learned at lot of new things. Arduino was something many of us never touched or have done. It was the same for Uppaal and Uppaal Tiga. \\
We could, with this project, apply the theory we have learned during the lessons to model and verify that our system, and controller, were working.
