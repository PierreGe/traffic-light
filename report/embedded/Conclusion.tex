\section{Conclusion}
Thanks to this project, we created a real (but small) embedded system that seems to work as expected. We also learned how to use Uppaal and Uppaal Tiga as well as Arduino programming. \\
We could, with this project, apply the theory learned during the lessons to model and verify that our system and controller were working.
