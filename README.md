## Requirements

### Embedded

Practical details:


The aim of the project is to design and implement an embedded system.
There is no fixed assignment: each team has to devise a topic to work on and send a description of the project to the teacher by the end of March for aproval. A special form is available on the main page for that purpose. To be acknowledged, the project should clearly demonstrate the ability of the team members to apply concepts, tools and techniques studied in at least one of the course chapters (for instance: using Scade to model and validate the system, or using UppAal TiGa or GVS+ to synthesise a part of the system, or applying a PID controler or enforcing real-time constraints thanks to RTAI...)
At the end of the term (date TBA) students will hand out a report that presents the project, and explains how the model-centric approach has been applied. The report should be clearly written in English, French or Dutch, adopting a presentation style up to professional standards. The report should clearly explain what has been done to meet the particular constraints that have been identified as pertaining to the project (correctness, real-time,...)
A project oral defense will take place during the examination session. During this defense, students are expected to briefly present their project and to make a demo. Please note that during the defense each team member maybe interrogated about each part of the project, in order to assess the individual participation of each member to the project.
Grading will be in accordance to the following scheme:
* 10 points to each group for the analysis
* 10 points to each group for the implementation
* 10 points to each student, to evaluate his/her capability of presenting the project. This mark will take into account the common report of the team, as well as the answers given by the individual during the oral defense.
These three marks will be averaged on 20, with the following weights: 8 points for the analysis, 6 points for the implementation and 6 points for the presentation.


### Formal verif
#### Goal.
The goal of the project is to implement a small reactive system, provide a formal model of this system, verify appropriate properties on this model using techniques presented in class and software verification tools, and possibly discover bugs and correct the system using these techniques.####  Deliverables. 
Written report (explaining the system, its conception, the verification process, how it helped and so on) and tool files (models, specifications).Evaluation. Quality of the written report and oral defense at the end of the semester. Please note that all students of the group are expected to be able to explain all parts of the project.#### Subject of the project. 
Our course is closely linked with INFOF410–Embedded Systems Design, taught by Gilles Geeraerts, in which students have to undertake a larger project, synthesizing correct controllers for reactive systems using appropriate tools. Therefore, for all students following both courses, we suggest (but it is not mandatory) that both projects are based on the same reactive system. Hence, students could develop the full project for INFOF410, and for our course, they could implement a smaller controller, model it and verify it as discussed before, and compare it with the other controller. Oral defenses could thus be merged. The interest for the students is a reduced workload (not having to develop two separate applications), thus more time to spend on the interesting parts of both projects.For all students (undertaking a common project or not), the choice of the application (reactive system to model) must be discussed with the teaching staff, which must confirm that it is suitable before starting the project. Deadlines for group formation and project choice will be announced in class and via Université Virtuelle.
